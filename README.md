# COVID Tracking Add-on for Google Sheets

This is the repository for the COVID Tracking Google Sheets Add-on.

## Why

Inspired by [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), this add-on tries to make it even easier for others to pull in data from the project directly into a Google Spreadsheet.
